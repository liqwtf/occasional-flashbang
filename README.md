# Occasional Flashbang

Have you ever thought to yourself: *"You know what would really improve this moment? Being completely, pathologically unable to see my own hands?"* Of course not, but **Occasional Flashbang** is here to fix that lack of imagination, as the mod nobody asked for. It's a total screen-melting white-out that hits you like a truck, followed by that high-pitched ringing that makes you wonder if your ears are actually about to explode.

*\- Because seeing things is overrated, anyways.*
